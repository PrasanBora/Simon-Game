# Simon-Game
Simon game is a remembering game ,
Computer will generate a random color and you have to remember color generated as well as previous color generated and 
if you entered the right color pattern you will be promoted to next level . 
For example:-
Game starts and computer generate a color { on any keypress }  let it be RED 
Now as a user input you have to clck to color generated RED and if both color {generated one and user input } are same you wil be promoted to next level i.e level 2
in next level computer again generate a color let it be BLUE and u have to remember it BUT THERE IS A CATCH you have to input all previous generated colors in the same
order they were generated i.e you will input first RED and then BLUE :)

So at level N you have to input all N previous computer generated color in the same order  to get promotion to next level .
                HOPE YOU WILL ENJOY PLAYNG IT :) ........
